""" Notes :

List comprehension shines in its simplicity and elegance
In terms of performance, both are comparable, but the list comprehension version tends to run a bit faster due to internal optimizations.
Because list comprehensions produce a list all at once, they can be memory intensive when dealing with large data sets. 
In situations where youâ€™re working with a large amount of data, using a list comprehension could potentially fill up your memory,
leading to performance issues or even causing your program to crash, however, they work perfectly with small data sets.
